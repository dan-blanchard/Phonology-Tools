Brent feature chart: 
	O may be wrong, it should correspond to É”.  
	Q and 7 are same, because don't know what to do with diphthongs other than look only at first vowel
	All of the rhotic vowels (# through R) could be wrong, as I just combined the features of what I thought was a vowel+r diphthong
	I cannot even slightly here the difference between 3 (bIRd) and R (buttER), but I thought maybe the second one was just a vocalic R, and the first was a shwa+r diphthong
